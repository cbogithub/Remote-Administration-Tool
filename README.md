# Remote-Administration-Tool
This tools is made to help me remote into my home computer. <br />
Originally this was made for an Arch environment but the demo had to be done in a room full of computers on Windows. <br />

Example commands:

ls<br />
ls ../ <br />
dir <br />

Note:

The pythoncom & pyhook is for Windows only.
